## 🎮 What is Nashle?

Nashle is an adversarial word guessing game inspired by Wordle, but with a crucial twist: **there is no pre-selected secret word**. Instead, after each of your guesses, the AI adversary chooses feedback that keeps as many words as possible consistent with all previous feedback. Your goal is to strategically corner the AI until only one word remains—and then name it within the guess limit.

Unlike cooperative games where feedback is designed to help you, Nashle pits you against an AI that actively tries to maintain ambiguity and maximize its options.

## 🧠 Game Theory Foundation

### The Nash Equilibrium Connection

The game is named after **John Nash** (of Nash Equilibrium fame) because it represents a **non-cooperative game** between two players:

1. **You (the Guesser)**: Try to eliminate possibilities and force a unique solution
2. **The AI (the Adversary)**: Try to maintain ambiguity by choosing feedback that maximizes the remaining candidate set

### Adversarial Feedback Strategy

The AI follows a **minimax-like strategy**:

- For each possible secret word, compute what feedback would be given
- Group words by the feedback they would produce
- **Choose the feedback that corresponds to the largest group** (maximizing remaining possibilities)
- On ties, prefer feedback with fewer green tiles (revealing less information)

This ensures the AI maintains as much ambiguity as possible, making your task progressively harder.

### Why This is Different from Wordle

- **Wordle**: Cooperative — the feedback is truthful and helpful
- **Nashle**: Adversarial — the feedback is truthful but strategically chosen to maximize ambiguity
- **Wordle**: One secret word chosen at start
- **Nashle**: No secret word initially; the AI chooses feedback that could be consistent with many words

This creates a dynamic where you must outthink not just the word, but the AI's strategy itself.

## 🎯 How to Play

### Basic Rules

1. **Objective**: Identify the correct 5-letter word within 9 guesses
2. **Winning Condition**: You win if:
   - There is exactly **1 word remaining** in the possible set
   - **AND** you guess that word correctly
   - **AND** you do so within the 9-guess limit

3. **Losing Condition**: The AI wins if:
   - You use all 9 guesses without correctly identifying the word when only 1 remains

### Gameplay Flow

1. **Make a Guess**: Enter any valid 5-letter word from the dictionary
2. **AI Responds**: The AI chooses feedback (green/yellow/gray) that:
   - Is consistent with at least one possible word
   - Maximizes the number of remaining candidate words
3. **View Feedback**:
   - 🟢 **Green (#00FF80)**: Letter is in the correct position
   - 🟡 **Yellow (#FFD300)**: Letter exists in the word but in a different position
   - ⬛ **Gray**: Letter is not in the word
4. **Track Progress**: Watch the "Rationality Meter" to see how many words remain possible
5. **Corner the AI**: Use strategic guesses to eliminate possibilities until only one word remains
6. **Win**: Guess the final word when the meter shows 1 remaining word

### Tips for Success

- **Early Game**: Use common words with diverse letter sets to quickly eliminate possibilities
- **Mid Game**: Focus on narrowing down based on known letters and positions
- **End Game**: When the meter shows few remaining words, guess strategically to identify the exact word
- **Watch the Meter**: The number of remaining words tells you how close you are to cornering the AI

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

#### Installing Node.js

**Windows:**
1. Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
4. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt or PowerShell and running:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**macOS:**
1. **Option A - Direct Download:**
   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Download the macOS installer (.pkg file)
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts

2. **Option B - Using Homebrew** (recommended):
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt update

# Install Node.js and npm
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

**Linux (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS):**
```bash
# Install Node.js and npm
sudo dnf install nodejs npm

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
# Install Node.js and npm
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nashle
   ```
   Or extract the ZIP file and navigate to the folder in your terminal.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all required packages (React, Vite, TailwindCSS, etc.)

3. **Configure Environment Variables (Optional)**
   
   For developer mode (shows solution list):
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add: `VITE_DEV_MODE=true`
   - Set to `false` or leave empty to disable

4. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The terminal will display a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

5. **Open in Browser**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory. To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Troubleshooting

**Port Already in Use:**
- If port 5173 is occupied, Vite will automatically try the next available port
- Check the terminal output for the actual URL

**Dependencies Installation Issues:**
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
- Run `npm install` again
- On Windows, you may need to run as Administrator

**Node.js Version Issues:**
- Ensure you have Node.js 16.0 or higher
- Use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to switch versions if needed
